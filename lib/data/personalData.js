    aboutMe:`
    I'm Yogesh Singh on the web. I'am a 23 y/o belonging to the Homo sapiens ü§£, a brother, a son, a friend, a self taugh web developer 
    
    and programmer.I have completed MCA(Master of Computer Application). I had already started programming back when I was in Second year 
   
    of BSc because first year pass in sportsüòÅ. I started web development mostly in frontend development at that time, I used only HTML 
    
    and CSS and simple javascript. If you want to know more about which programming I know they are - Python(‚ù§Ô∏è), Javascript and framework 
    
    - ReactJs,NextJs,Tailwind CSS, "MERN Stack(Learning)". Things I do other than dev and programming. Apart from that, I enjoy playing cricket (üèè). 
    
    Touching grass is important. Sometimes listening soft music and seeing clouds passing üò≥. I also play mobile games like BattleRoyal game.
    
    Apart from this, I don't have much to do other than overthinking and staring at my phone screen.I like making friends (be it online or irl 
    
    though I'm somewhat introverted!). So, in case you want to talk about anything leave messages. I'll get back to you once I'm active. That's pretty much everything about me.`
